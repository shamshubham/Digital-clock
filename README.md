## Introduction

The **Digital Clock** project showcases a modern and accurate real-time clock. Utilizing JavaScript, it fetches the current time from the user's device, ensuring precision. The design is minimalist yet elegant, making it a perfect addition to any website or application.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- üåê A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- üìö Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd digital-clock
   ```

2. **Open the Project**:

   Launch the `index.html` file in your web browser to experience the digital clock in action.

## Usage

To use the Digital Clock:

1. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
2. The clock will automatically display the current time, updating every second to reflect real-time changes.

## Code Overview

### 1. HTML Structure

The `index.html` file lays out the structure of the clock. It includes:

- **Clock Container**: A `div` that houses the entire clock interface.
- **Time Display**: Separate `div` elements for hours (`hrs`), minutes (`min`), and seconds (`sec`).

### 2. CSS Styling

The `style.css` file provides the styling, giving the clock a modern and stylish look:

- **Clock Container**: Defines the overall appearance and positioning.
- **Digits Styling**: Ensures a clean and readable font and layout for the time display.

### 3. JavaScript Functionality

JavaScript, embedded within the HTML, drives the real-time functionality:

- **Element Selection**: Uses `document.getElementById` to target the time display elements.
- **Time Update Logic**: A `setInterval` function updates the time every second. The `Date` object fetches the current hours, minutes, and seconds. The script formats each time unit with leading zeros if necessary, ensuring a consistent display format.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Defines the clock's structure.
- **CSS3**: Provides styling and layout, ensuring a modern aesthetic.
- **JavaScript**: Powers the real-time update mechanism.
