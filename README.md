## Introduction

The Digital Clock project showcases a real-time clock display. It utilizes JavaScript to fetch the current time from the user's system and updates every second. The clock is styled with CSS to provide a clean and modern appearance.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- Basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd digital-clock
   ```

2. **Open the Project**:

   Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to view the digital clock.

## Usage

Simply open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser, and the clock will display the current time, updating every second.

## Code Overview

### 1. HTML Structure

The `index.html` file contains the structure of the digital clock, including a container for the clock display. The time is displayed in a `div` with `id`s for hours (`hrs`), minutes (`min`), and seconds (`sec`).

### 2. CSS Styling

The CSS file (`style.css`) styles the clock to give it a modern look. It includes styles for the container and the clock digits.

### 3. JavaScript Functionality

The JavaScript code within the `<script>` tag in the HTML file provides the logic for the clock:

- **Selecting Elements**: The `document.getElementById` method is used to select the HTML elements where the time will be displayed.
- **Updating Time**: A `setInterval` function is used to update the time every second. The `Date` object is utilized to get the current hours, minutes, and seconds. The code ensures that each component of the time is displayed with two digits by adding a leading zero if necessary.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Structure and layout of the clock.
- **CSS3**: Styling of the clock.
- **JavaScript**: Real-time update functionality.
